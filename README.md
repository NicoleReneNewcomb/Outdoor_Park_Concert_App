# Outdoor Park Concert App
Manages Ticket Sales and Seating Assignments

This app provides a simple seating chart that is saved and 
retrieved via a JSON file. It assigns additional spacing 
needed around reserved seats due to COVID. It also manages 
concert seat ticket purchases by showing seat pricing and
availability (checking for conflicts before sale), recording
ticket sales, creating receipts for users, and keeping track
of the running sales total.
